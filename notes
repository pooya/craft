* The http url passed to the http.Get method should not have a tailing \n
* We can use the os package and its Args array to look at the arguments

* It seems like when serving pages, the trailing '/' is important.
    If we do not put it, the only page that will be given to that handler is
    a page that ends with the exact same command.
